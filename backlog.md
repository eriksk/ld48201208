## Game description


### Idea 1
_Mutant Evolution X_
You play as an escaped mutant. You fight the police who are trying to kill you.
If you die, you restart, but the mutation has gone further and you have evolved with
some new ability. (Like an extra arm or whatnot)
As you evolve it will become easier to kill the police and escape the city!
- Lots of dynamic actions, pretty hard

### Idea 2
_Evolverine_ 
A game where you play as a character that evolves constantly. 
You have to press the right buttons at the right time or the evolution
will go wrong and you will become a mutant freak.
To win the game you have to evolve into Morgan Freeman.
- Hard to do with graphics
- easy gameplay
- not so fun?

## Idea 3
Take a simple game, say breakout. Make it as basic as possible. As the game progresses, 
add more visual effects and more logic, making the game evolve. At the max stage it
should be fucking crazy!
- Lots of tweenings and juice
- easy
- fast to code
- I can never be not done. Keep adding stuff until the deadline! 

## Idea 4
Platformer.
You play as a basic character.
Brawler style.
No cam, screens instead.
You can alter your own DNA to use different abilities, buy only one at a time?
Think Heroes. But you have to steal DNA from other people.
Abilities:
	* Invulnerable
	* Invisible
	* Strength
	* Take abilities from others
	* Cat
	* Rat
